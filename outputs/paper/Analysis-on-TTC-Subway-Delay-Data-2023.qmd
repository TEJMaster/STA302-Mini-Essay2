## Introduction

Public transportation, like the TTC (Toronto Transit Commission), is essential for city life. In Toronto, many people rely on the TTC every day. However, it's not always smooth sailing. A survey in May 2019 showed mixed feelings about the TTC: about two-thirds of riders are happy with things like how clean it is and the cost, but nearly half of the people are often late because of unexpected delays, especially during busy hours [@Vuong_2019]. These delays can really disrupt daily routines and make people wonder how well the TTC is being run.

This project digs into the TTC subway delay data for 2023 from OpenDataToronto using a data set called "subway_delay_data_2023.csv". We want to find patterns in the delays to help understand and fix the problems. This is especially important as more and more people are living in Toronto, and they all need a reliable subway system. Even with the issues, a good number of users, 77%, still think the TTC is dependable, which shows that the system has a strong base to improve from [@Vuong_2019].

Here is a brief summary of findings from the TTC subway delay dataset: 
**1.** Delays are more common on weekdays compared to weekends.
**2.** Subway Lines 1 and 2 generally have more delays than Lines 3 and 4. 
**3.** Delays tend to happen more often during busy hours, and delay in evening rush hours is more frequent compared to morning rush hours.

This study is not just an investigation; it's a crucial step towards improving the TTC subway's reliability and efficiency, meeting the needs of Toronto's ever-expanding community.

## Data

Data for this study were obtained from the Open Data Toronto Portal via the opendatatoronto package [@rOpenDataToronto]. The primary dataset utilized is the TTC subway delay data for 2023. This dataset offers a granular view into each recorded delay within the TTC subway system, encapsulating critical attributes such as the date, time, duration, and affected subway line.

### TTC Subway Delay Data

This dataset, provided by the Toronto Transit Commission via the Open Data Toronto Portal, captures comprehensive information about delays occurring within the TTC subway network throughout 2023. As of the data retrieval date, the dataset includes detailed records of each delay event, structured with several key fields to offer insights into the nature and impact of these delays. Initial inspection of the data revealed fields such as 'Date', 'Time', 'Station', 'Line', 'Min Delay', and 'Reason for Delay', among others. However, it was noted that not all records were complete, necessitating a rigorous data cleaning process.

### Data Cleaning and Initial Observations
The raw data was initially fetched and then subjected to a systematic cleaning process to ensure data integrity for analysis (Please refer to appendix for details). After-cleaning, an initial exploration of the data was conducted below, providing some insight about how the dataset is looked like.

```{r table1, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(head(clean_subway_delay_data, 6), 
             caption = "Sample of the Cleaned TTC Subway Delay Data",
             format = "markdown")
```

Table 1 displays the first 6 rows of the cleaned TTC subway delay data set.

### Measurement and Variable Description

- Date: The date on which the delay occurred, providing a chronological context to the incident.
- Time: The exact time at which the delay was recorded, which is crucial for identifying peak delay periods throughout the day.
- Day: The day of the week, offering insights into how delays might fluctuate on weekdays versus weekends.
- Min Delay: The reported duration of the delay in minutes, reflecting the severity of the incident.
- Line: The subway line on which the delay occurred, essential for recognizing which lines are most frequent to delays.

## Data Analysis & Results

The data analysis was performed using R [@r], a powerful open-source statistical programming language. Key packages from the tidyverse collection [@rTidyverse] were employed to streamline data manipulation, visualization, and analysis processes. These packages include ggplot2 [@rGgplot2] for creating advanced graphics, dplyr [@rDplyr] for data manipulation, readr [@rReadr] for its robust data reading functionalities, lubridate [@lubridate] for handling date-time data, here [@R-here] is used to avoid file path issue, and knitr [@rKnitr] for dynamic report generation. 

### Analysis on subway delay based on day of the week 

From @fig-subway_delay_day, we can clearly see that weekdays experience significantly longer cumulative delay duration as compared to weekends. Notably, Monday stands out with the highest aggregate minutes of delay, suggesting a peak in delay occurrences at the start of the workweek. Conversely, Saturday is the day with the least total delay time, indicating a smoother operational flow during weekend services.

From @fig-subway_delay_day_freq the frequency analysis of delays corroborates the trend observed in total delay duration. Weekdays generally have a higher incidence of delays, with Friday leading in the number of reported delays. On the other hand, during Sunday the plot shows the least frequency of delays, aligning with the expected reduced demand for travel on the last day of the weekend.


These insights could serve as a cornerstone for targeted strategies aimed at improving service efficiency, such as enhanced resource allocation during identified peak times. Commuters might also benefit from planning their travel schedules around these insights to avoid potential delays.

### Analysis on subway delay based subway line

```{r fig-subway_delay_line_freq, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Frequency of subway delays categorized by subway line"}

frequency_of_delays_by_line <- clean_subway_delay_data %>%
  filter(Line %in% c("BD", "YU", "SHP", "SRT")) %>%
  group_by(Line) %>%
  summarize(Delay_Frequency = n()) # Count the number of delay occurrences for each line


ggplot(frequency_of_delays_by_line, aes(x = Line, y = Delay_Frequency, fill = Line)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +

        axis.title.x = element_text(margin = margin(t = 5, b = 10)), 
        legend.position = "bottom") + 
  guides(fill=guide_legend(title=NULL))

```

@fig-subway_delay_line_freq, indicates a substantial contrast in delay frequencies across different subway lines for the year 2023. Lines labeled 'SHP' (Line 4) and 'SRT' (Line 3) are notable for having much less delays, possibly reflecting efficient operations. Conversely, lines such as 'BD' (line 2) and 'YU' (line 1) report a high frequency of delays. This observed pattern calls for targeted operational focus. As a manager of TTC's subway system, these findings warrant a comprehensive analysis to understand the underlying causes of these delays. Furthermore, commuters who frequent these lines may wish to factor in additional travel time in anticipation of potential delays.

#### List of TTC Subway Line Codes and Their Corresponding Full Names:

- **YU**: Yonge-University Line (Line 1)
- **BD**: Bloor-Danforth Line (Line 2)
- **SRT**: Scarborough RT Line (Line 3)
- **SHP**: Sheppard Line (Line 4)

### Analysis on subway delay based on time of the day 

```{r fig-subway_delay_time_freq, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Frequency of subway delays categorized by time of the day"}
# Convert 'Time' column to a date-time object (assuming 'Time' is formatted as 'HH:MM')
clean_subway_delay_data$Hour <- hour(hms(clean_subway_delay_data$Time))

# Ensure Hour is a factor and reorder levels to start from 4 AM and wrap around after 23 to 0-3 AM
clean_subway_delay_data$Hour <- factor(clean_subway_delay_data$Hour, 
                                       levels = c(4:23, 0:3))

# Group and summarize the data to get the frequency of delays by hour
frequency_of_delays_by_hour <- clean_subway_delay_data %>%
  filter(`Min Delay` > 0) %>%
  count(Hour)  # Count the number of delay occurrences for each hour

# Plot the data with the reordered hours without the legend
ggplot(frequency_of_delays_by_hour, aes(x = Hour, y = n, fill = Hour)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "Frequency of TTC Subway Delays by Hour of the Day",
       x = "Hour of the Day",
       y = "Number of Delays") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1),
        legend.position = "none") 

```

The data illustrated in @fig-subway_delay_time_freq showcases the distribution of TTC subway delays throughout the day. Notably, there are significant peaks in the number of delays around 8 a.m. and again between 4 p.m. and 5 p.m., reflecting the typical rush hour periods when the subway system is under the most strain from high passenger volumes. Moreover, the number of delays in the evening rush hour is much higher compared to moring rush hour, suggesting a greater crowd level. Outside of these peak times, the frequency of delays appears relatively consistent, averaging approximately 300 instances per hour over the course of the year. It is important to note that the TTC subway's operational hours are from 6 a.m. to 2 a.m., as stated by the official TTC schedule [@TTC]. The occurrence of delays recorded outside these operational hours, specifically at 2 a.m. and 5 a.m. to 6 a.m., may be attributed to late-night service extensions, early morning starts, or ongoing service from the previous day that has not been concluded after the end of service time.

## Conclusion

The comprehensive analysis of the 2023 TTC subway delay data has yielded some actionable insights, leading to a set of recommendations aimed at enhancing the commuting experience.. For daily commuters, especially those frequenting the more delay-prone Lines 1 and 2 during peak hours, proactive planning is advisable. Allocating extra travel time can significantly mitigate the inconvenience caused by delays, ensuring a more predictable and stress-free journey.

On an operational level, the findings of this study underscore the necessity for the TTC management to undertake a comprehensive review of current practices, particularly focusing on the identified peak times and lines where delays are most prevalent. A targeted approach to understanding and rectifying the root causes of these delays can not only improve service reliability but also elevate public perception and trust in the TTC subway system.

This report, therefore, not only furnishes a detailed account of the current state of subway delays but also sets the stage for strategic interventions and continuous improvements. The objective is to improve the subway system that is not just punctual and efficient but also resilient and responsive to the needs of a growing and dynamic Toronto.

### Data Simulation 

The simulated dataset, designed to mirror the structure of the actual TTC subway delay data, can be found at `scripts/00-simulate-data_data.R`. This script meticulously generates a dataset of 1000 hypothetical delay instances, providing a sandbox environment for testing analytical methods. The dataset encompasses variables such as 'Date', 'Day', 'SubwayID', 'Time', and 'Delay_Durations', mimicking the real-world data structure.

### Download Data from OpenDataToronto

For details about download the data set from OpenDataToronto, please check the script located at `scripts/01_download_data.R`. This script retrieves the TTC Subway delay data for the year 2023 using the package called `opendatatoronto` [@rOpenDataToronto] and save to a file at `inputs/data/subway_delay_data_2023.csv`.

### Data Cleaning Process

Data cleaning is a critical step in ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the analysis. The detailed procedure and the R script used for data cleaning are available in `scripts/02_cleanup_data.R`. The script elucidates the steps taken to refine the dataset by filtering out incomplete records and focusing on relevant subway lines. The cleaned dataset is conveniently saved at `outputs/data/cleaned_subway_delay_data_2023.csv`, ready for in-depth analysis.

### Data Set Validity Testing

To affirm the integrity and consistency of the cleaned dataset, a series of validation tests are performed using the script `scripts/03-test-data-validity.R`. This script performs three crucial checks to ensure the data set's accuracy and consistency:

1. Year Consistency: Verifies that all entries in the 'Date' column correspond to the year 2023.
2. Minute Delay not Negative: Confirms that all values in the 'Min Delay' column are greater than or equal to zero, ensuring no negative delay times are recorded.
3. Line Validation: Ensures that the 'Line' column includes only the subway lines in Toronto: "BD" (Bloor-Danforth), "YU" (Yonge-University), "SHP" (Sheppard), and "SRT" (Scarborough RT).

After running this script, it's expected that the variables `test_year_2023`, `test_min_delay_non_negative`, and `test_line_inclusion` should all return TRUE, indicating that the data set meets the specified criteria for each test. If any of these checks fail, it would suggest discrepancies within the data set that may require further investigation or correction.
