# TTC Subway Delay Analysis 2023

This repository contains the project "TTC Subway Delay Analysis 2023," focusing on exploring and analyzing the subway delay data provided by OpenDataToronto. The aim is to identify patterns in the Toronto Transit Commission's (TTC) subway delays and offer insights that can help commuters and transit authorities in planning and managing subway travel more effectively. 

In the creation of this project, OpenAI's ChatGPT was used to enhance the paragraphs, as well as assist in generating the plots. You can check the input/misc/chat_with_chatGPT.txt for a complete conversation of my usage of ChatGPT in this project.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows to ensure easy navigation and accessibility of the project components:

- `inputs/data/`: This directory stores the dataset used in the project. The main dataset, `subway_delay_data_2023.csv`, sourced from OpenDataToronto, is stored here. 
- `inputs/misc/`: This directory stores the miscellaneous components used for project creation. 

- `outputs/`: This folder contains the main outputs of the project:
  - `outputs/data/`: This directory contains the output of the cleaned dataset after the data cleaning process.
  - `outputs/paper/`: This directory stores the report of the actual paper. 

- `scripts/`: This folder contains some R scripts for this project.
